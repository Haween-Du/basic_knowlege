    /*
      so here we gonna implement the function flat, as we all know, it usually used to hanlde the nested array.
    like this array, it has mutiple element, which are also an arrays.
      let's start by difine a flatten, which is a function. and it gonna recieve an array.
    because we should get a new array. so we define result. and then we also need define function called dfs.
    because we need handle the nested array. and now we will use for of to loop over each item.
    using the array dot is array to check if the current item is an array or not. 
      if so, we should use recursion, just like call the dfs with the current element. and if not,
    we just need use push methods to push the element into the result.
      obviously we should check if this flat is right. so we should call the function with an array.
    and logging it to consloe. in this way, we can check the output. 
      actually it's just a way to implement the flat. there are so many ways to implement it. but here i just tell 
    you this way for it. bascially i will there are several people who can figure out what better way to
    solve this problem.
