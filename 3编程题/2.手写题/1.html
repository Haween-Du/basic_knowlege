    /*
      now let's talk about how to implement the debounce function, before we solve it.
    we should know the concept, what's the debounce. if we click the button, and it will trigger
    a function. but when click too fast. it will response two times, even more.
    at this point, we should ignore the more clicks. just like let the first click happen.
      this is debounce. so let's get started. first we define debounce, which gonna accept
    a function and delay. inside of the debounce, we define timer, we don't need assign anything
    to it right now. and then we should return an anonymous function, and it will recieve arguments 
    with the spread operator. and then we should check if the timer is equal to null, if so,
      we can use the clearTimeout to clear it. and if not, we should set timer equal to setTimeout,
    and it will accept a function, and a delay, inside of this anonymous function, we can call fn with the args
